# DMP-gen

A DMP generator for imitation learning and reinforcement learning purposes in the long run. Some parts of the code is taken from Assoc. Prof. [Erhan Ã–ztop](http://robotics.ozyegin.edu.tr/members/erhan-oztop/) from Ozyegin University and his M.Sc. student [Alp Burak Pehlivan](https://github.com/AlpX)'s implementation of [DMP](https://github.com/AlpX/DMP-LWR).

Just run main.m with data_dim = 2 to use 2D version. Please contact me for the 3D data if you need it.
